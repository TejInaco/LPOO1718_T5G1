 * @category Containing the classes for the game logic
 * 
 * @brief This package should have, at least, the following classes 
 * (with attributes private or protected, and non static):
 *     A class to represent the state of the game, storing the current map
 * and the game elements (hero, guard, ogre, lever, etc.). It should provide an
 * API (constructors and public methods), to be used by the user interaction package
 * to, a least: instantiate a new game, issue a hero's movement action, checking the 
 * game state (game over?), getting the map in order to print it (using toString might
 * be a possibility);
 *  	A class to represent the current level map. Several classes to represent the
 * game elements that might be present within the game level (hero, guard, ...) and
 * their status. These should have a super-class with the common properties 
 * (coordinates, etc.), exploiting inheritance and polymorphism accordingly (having 
 * the specific behaviour of each game element in its respective class).
