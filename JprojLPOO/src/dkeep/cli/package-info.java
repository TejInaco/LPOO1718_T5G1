 * 
 * @brief The user interaction package should have, at least, one class with 
 * the main method entry point and possible auxiliary methods for handling input.
 * It is recommended to place the "game loop/cycle" in this package. 
 * The game "loop" consists of: continuously asking the user to enter a command;
 * running the game logic accordingly (to that command) and updating the game state;
 * printing the game screen; until the game is over (hero dies or wins).
